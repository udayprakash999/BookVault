In a quaint village nestled at the foot of a great mountain, there lived a humble stonecutter named Kavi. Every day, he toiled under the blazing sun, chiseling rocks into slabs to sell to the townsfolk. Though hardworking, Kavi often felt unfulfilled. He dreamed of a grander life but believed he was destined for nothing more than breaking stones.

One particularly hot afternoon, as Kavi worked in the shadow of the mountain, he noticed a wealthy merchant passing by on horseback. The merchant was adorned in fine silks, his hands heavy with gold rings. Townsfolk stepped aside, bowing in respect as he passed.

Kavi sighed deeply, wiping the sweat from his brow. "How powerful the merchant is," he thought. "If only I could be as powerful as him, my life would be perfect."

To his astonishment, a mysterious voice whispered in the wind: “Your wish is granted.”

In the blink of an eye, Kavi found himself transformed into the wealthy merchant. He now wore luxurious robes and rode a magnificent horse. People bowed to him, and his life was filled with comfort.

For a while, Kavi was happy. But one day, as he traveled, the scorching sun beat down upon him, making him feel faint. He gazed up at the fiery orb and thought, "The sun is far more powerful than any man. It shines on everyone and cannot be stopped. I wish I could be the sun."

Again, the voice whispered: “Your wish is granted.”

Kavi became the sun, glowing fiercely in the sky. He felt invincible as he poured his light and heat onto the earth. But soon, he noticed something strange. A dark cloud drifted by, blocking his rays and casting shadows below.

“How powerful that cloud is,” Kavi thought. “It can stop even me. I wish I could be the cloud.”

“Your wish is granted.”

As the cloud, Kavi floated freely in the sky, covering the sun and bringing rain to the land below. He enjoyed his newfound power until he encountered the mountain. No matter how much rain he poured onto its slopes or how fiercely the wind blew, the mountain stood immovable, defiant.

“The mountain is the most powerful of all,” Kavi thought. “I wish I could be the mountain.”

“Your wish is granted.”

Kavi became the mountain, towering over the land. He felt unshakable, invincible. But his peace was short-lived. One day, he felt a sharp pain deep within him. A stonecutter was chiseling away at his base, carving slabs from his very body.

He realized, with sudden clarity, that the stonecutter was more powerful than the mountain itself.

“I wish to be the stonecutter again,” Kavi whispered.

“Your wish is granted.”

Kavi found himself back in his humble workshop, holding his chisel and hammer. But this time, he didn’t feel resentment or longing for a different life. He understood that true power lay in perseverance, skill, and the ability to shape the world with his own hands.

From that day forward, Kavi worked with a renewed sense of purpose. He no longer compared himself to others or wished to be something he was not. Instead, he poured his heart into his craft, becoming the most renowned stonecutter in the land.

And so, Kavi’s life transformed—not because of riches or magic, but because he embraced the power within himself.
